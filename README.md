# AudioPreamplifier
  In this project, I designed and built an audio preamplifier with adjustable voltage amplification to enhance sound quality and provide precise control over the audio signal. The circuit was developed using Cadence OrCAD, where I created and simulated the schematic to ensure optimal performance.

For PCB design, I worked with PCB Editor, learning how to place components efficiently, route traces, and generate manufacturing files. To verify my design before fabrication, I used GerbTool to inspect the Gerber files and ensure accuracy in the final layout.

This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in circuit design, PCB layout, and the overall process of designing and manufacturing a functional electronic system.

  Here are the following folders: 
  
  Gerber_Excellon – Contains Gerber files and Excellon drill files, which are used for PCB fabrication and drilling. These files are essential for manufacturing the PCB.

  Layout – Stores PCB layout files, created in Cadence PCB Editor, which define the physical arrangement of components and traces on the board.

  PCB_FOOTPRINT_TME_LIBRARIES – Holds footprint libraries for PCB components,  sourced from TME,which I used for placing the components on the board.

  SCHEMATIC – Contains the schematic design files, divided into:

   PSpice Simulation – Includes the schematic designed for circuit simulation in PSpice, used to test and verify the amplification circuit before implementation.
  
   PCB Layout – Holds schematic files specifically adapted for PCB design.
