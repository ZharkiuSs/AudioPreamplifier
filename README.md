# AudioPreamplifier
  In this project, I designed and built an audio preamplifier with adjustable voltage amplification to enhance sound quality and provide precise control over the audio signal. The circuit was developed using Cadence OrCAD, where I created and simulated the schematic to ensure optimal performance.

For PCB design, I worked with PCB Editor, learning how to place components efficiently, route traces, and generate manufacturing files. To verify my design before fabrication, I used GerbTool to inspect the Gerber files and ensure accuracy in the final layout.

This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in circuit design, PCB layout, and the overall process of designing and manufacturing a functional electronic system.
